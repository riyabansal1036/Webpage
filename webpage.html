    HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies
  for building Web pages. ...
           HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. ...
 CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.

    <h2> HTML</h2><br>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce
    content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the
        page.
        <br>
    <h2>CSS</h2><br>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
    presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
    separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css
    file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. -->
